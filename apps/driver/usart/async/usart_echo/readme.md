### Setting up [SAM L22 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATSAML22-XPRO-B)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera Term) on the computer.
2. Configure the serial port settings as follows:
    Baud : 115200

    Data : 8 Bits
    
    Parity : None
    
    Stop : 1 Bit
    
    Flow Control : None
3. Build and program the application using its IDE.
4. Type a character and observe the output on the console as shown below:
    - On success, the character typed is echoed back and an LED toggles each time a character is echoed.
